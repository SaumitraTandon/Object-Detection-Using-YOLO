# Computer Vision Masterclass - Object Detection with YOLO

This repository contains the Jupyter notebook for the "Computer Vision Masterclass" focusing on using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm for object detection in images. YOLO is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system that can detect multiple objects in an image with high accuracy.

## Introduction

YOLO is a popular object detection algorithm due to its speed and accuracy. It frames object detection as a single regression problem, straight from image pixels to bounding box coordinates and class probabilities.

## Object Detection in Images

In this section, we explore the basics of object detection using the YOLO algorithm. We start with the theory behind YOLO and then move on to implementation details, demonstrating how to use YOLO to detect objects in images.

## Installation

To run the notebook, you need to install the necessary Python packages. You can do this using pip.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To use the notebook, simply open it in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed, and then you can run the cells sequentially to train and evaluate the YOLO model.

```bash
jupyter notebook "Computer Vision Masterclass - Object detection with YOLO.ipynb"
```

## Examples

The notebook includes several examples demonstrating the use of YOLO for object detection. These examples cover:

- Loading a pre-trained YOLO model
- Detecting objects in a sample image
- Fine-tuning the YOLO model on a custom dataset

Each example includes detailed explanations and code to help you understand how YOLO works and how it can be applied to object detection tasks.
